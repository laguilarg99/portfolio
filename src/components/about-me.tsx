            Hello! I'm Luis Miguel, a passionate software developer.
            I enjoy learning new technologies and solving challenging problems. 
            I am always willing to learn new things, individually and as a team and 
            I consider that my abilities to do so are quite good, thanks to my strong will 
            and perseverance in those projects that I know will make me improve as an engineer.
